HTML Basics:

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
Single-closing tags cannot enclose raw text or other elements.
Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files.
The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
A webpage's title appears in a browser's tab.
Code for visible HTML content is placed inside of the <body> element.




HTML Common Tags:

Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.
Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and addings ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
The nav element contains links to internal pages or content.





HTML Table Elements & Tags:

The <table> element creates a table.
The <tr> element adds rows to a table.
To add data to a row, you can use the <td> element.
Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the <th> element.
Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.
Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
A table's head is created with the <thead> element.
A table's body is created with the <tbody> element.
A table's footer is created with the <tfoot> element.

HMTL Grid

Grid Layout - Fastest way to making responsive rows/blocks for Website Layouts
<body>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="box a">A</div>
    <div class="box b">B</div>
    <div class="box c">C</div>
    <div class="box d">D</div>
    <div class="box e">E</div>
  </div>
</body>

grid-template-areas specifies grid named grid areas
grid layouts are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.
justify-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
justify-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
justify-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
align-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
align-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
align-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
grid-auto-rows specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
grid-auto-columns specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
grid-auto-flow specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created
